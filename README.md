# The Tech Corner

Main repo for The Tech Corner You Tube channel.

This repository will house the files that are referenced in **The Tech Corner** You Tube Channel.

There are several reasons for using a GitHub repository.

1. Since most of the files will be How To files, examples of code exercices, AI prompts, etc. It will be more convenient to bookmark and access a single repository then several You Tube videos.

2. It will be easier to keep the information current in a repository then trying to update a You Tube video.

3. Community contributions! People will be able to submit Pull Requests to enhance, update or contribute new content to the repository.
