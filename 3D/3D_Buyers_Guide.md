## When buying your first 3D printer, there are several key factors to consider.

### Budget

1. 3D printers range in price from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Determine how much you're willing to spend.

### Print Technology

1. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): The most common type, using a plastic filament that is melted and extruded.
2. Stereolithography (SLA)/Digital Light Processing (DLP): Uses liquid resin cured by light, offering higher precision but often at a higher cost.
3. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Uses laser or agents to fuse powder material. 

### Print Volume

1. The maximum size of objects you can print. Consider the types of projects you'll be working on.

### Print Quality

1. Factors like layer resolution and accuracy affect the smoothness and detail of your prints.

### Ease of Use

1. Look for features like auto-leveling, a user-friendly interface, and good documentation.

### Material Compatibility

1. Some printers are limited to certain types of filament. Consider the materials you want to print with (PLA, ABS, PETG, etc.).

### Community and Support

1. A strong online community and good customer support can be invaluable when you're starting out.

## Additional considerations include

### Enclosed vs. Open Frame

1. Enclosed printers offer better temperature control and can be safer, especially for materials like ABS.

### Noise Level

1. 3D printers can be noisy. Consider where you'll be using it.

### Upgradability

1. Some printers can be upgraded with new features or components, extending their lifespan.

### Open source vs. Proprietary

1. Open source parts/software vs. proprietary

## By carefully considering these factors, you can choose a 3D printer that meets your needs and provides a positive first experience with 3D printing
